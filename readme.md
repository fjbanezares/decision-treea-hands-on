# Decission Trees

## What are?

Probabilistic data structure.

We create nodes and transitions based on gaining in information aiming for purity on the next node.

To measure the purity we use Gini or Entropy reduction.

Gini = 0 or Entropy = 0 means perfect purity, in general we set some threshold

## Use
We will use the decision tree mainly for classification based on values of certain features.
